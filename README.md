# Weather App

A simple weather application built to display current weather information for any city using the [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/). This app fetches weather data such as temperature, condition, wind speed, and more, displaying it in a clean and simple UI.

## About This Project

This project was created back in 2023 while I was learning web development and exploring how to make interactive webpages. I found this project on an old USB drive and decided to give it a quick update.

> **Note:** This project was built as a learning exercise, and it hasn't been significantly modified since its creation. For example, there is no `.env` file because I didn't know how to use environment variables back then. 


### Updates Made

- Added comments to the code for better readability.
- Updated the API key to reflect current access credentials (please replace the API key with your own in the `script.js` file).


## Features

- **Current Weather**: Displays the temperature, condition, and location information.
- **Detailed Weather**: Toggle to show or hide detailed information like wind speed, wind direction, etc.
- **Interactive UI**: Clean and simple UI built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
